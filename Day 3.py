# List
# List is similar to array
# we can store any data type.
# list are mutable means data can easy change without creating new list

# friends = ['apple', 'Roshan', 7, 7.77, True]

# list are mutable
# we can change the values

# friends[0] = 'banana'

# print(friends)

# print(friends[1:4])

l1 = [1,3,7,4,5,6,2]

# Methods :
# l1.append(3)
# l1.sort()
# l1.reverse()
# l1.pop(3)
# print(l1)




# Tuples
# tuples are like list but they are un-mutable
# cannont change the value of tuple list

# a = (1,2,3,4,5)
# b = (1,) # to show this is tuple if we don't use comma then python think that it is integer
# print(type(a))
